The platform combines the features of an e-commerce website and an auction platform, with a built-in bid system and a public chat during auctions.

## Features

- **User Management**: Robust user management system to cater to diverse user needs.
- **Shopping Cart**: A shopping cart feature that allows users to add their favourite items and proceed to checkout.
- **Error Handling**: Effective error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience.
- **Integrated Online Marketplace**: Combines the features of an e-commerce website and an auction platform.
- **Built-in Bid System**: Allows users to place bids on products.
- **Public Chat**: Enables users to communicate during auctions.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: NextJs, ReactJs, styled-components
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get a local development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/anuj3366/bidcommerce.git
    ```

2. **Navigate into the directory**
    ```
    cd bidcommerce
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**
    Navigate into the directory and run:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the development servers**
    Navigate into the directory and run:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

Your application should now be running on `localhost`. The frontend will typically be on `localhost:1234`, and the backend will be on `65.0.145.134:3000`.

## Deployment

The frontend will be deployed on Netlify, and the backend will be deployed on either Netlify or Render. Detailed instructions for deployment will be provided at a later stage.
